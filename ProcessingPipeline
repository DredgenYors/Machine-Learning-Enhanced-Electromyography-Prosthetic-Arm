Processing Order:
1. Amplification of RAW EMG (usually controlled by hardware or some software)
2. Filtering 
3. Windowing (to break up the stream of data and create points for decision making)
4. Feature Extraction (Root Mean Square (RMS), Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Zero Crossings (ZC), Slope Sign Changes (SSC), Waveform Length (WL))
5. Classification (Convert signal to command)

Filtering Break Down
1. Bandpass Filter (20 - 500 Hz) - removes unwanted highs and lows
2. Notch Filter (50 - 60 Hz) - removes interference
3. Mean Subtraction - removes the DC component/offset/bias
4. Rectification (Absolute Value) - converts bipolar signal to unipolar signal for envelope detection
5. Low-Pass Envelope Filter (2 - 6 Hz) - smooths signal for muscle activation detection

Feature Extraction Breakdown
1. RMS - measure of signal magnitude, a power indicator of muscle detection. Higher RMS = stronger contraction
2. MAV - average amplitude of the EMG signal, average muscle activity over a window, smooth indicator of sustained muscle activation
3. ZC - count of oscillations around zero, signal complexity measure, fast vs slow contractions
4. SSC - count of slope direction changes, fewer slope changes = well-coordinated, more slope changes = fine motor control
5. WL - total signal variation over time window, cumulative activity measurement, active vs passive states, total measure of signal variance, "work" or "effort" in window
